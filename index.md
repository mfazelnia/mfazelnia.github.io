I am a final year Ph.D. student in the department of Computer Science at University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI, USA, under the supervision of [Professor Mirakhorli](https://mehdimirakhorli.github.io). I started my Ph.D. at the Rochester Institute of Technology and transferred to the beautiful Hawaii with our lab for the rest of my Ph.D. journey. Prior to that, I received my B.Sc. from Sharif University of Technology. 

Broadly, I am interested in trustworthy AI, quantitiave modeling, LLMs, and formal methods. I was also a Machine Learning Intern at Hitachi, Santa Clara, CA, USA working on multimodal retrival and recommendation systems. 

When I'm away from the screen, you'll find me surfing 🏄‍♂️ or hiking 🏔️!
